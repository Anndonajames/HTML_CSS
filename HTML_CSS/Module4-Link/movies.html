<p>The Armenian restaurants offer a wide variety of <cite>dishes, delicious food, <strong>sweets</strong>, and bakings</cite>. The most famous Armenian dishes are barbeque, dolma, fish, khash, harissa, aveluk, and many more. National Armenian restaurants
    try to bring back the right Armenian breakfast and the <i>tradition of having breakfast<i>. They say that once it was <del>accepted </del>ato have a so-called <ins>"Brduchayin Nakhachash ()"</ins> that means "A Sandwich Breakfast". This "brduch" is an Armenian sandwich made of
    Armenian lavash<em> (Armenian bread)</em>, meal, and nut. Besides national Armenian restaurants, there are <q>also some foreign </q>arestaurants in Armenia which once more proves the Armenians' love towards the restaurant and food culture.</p>
